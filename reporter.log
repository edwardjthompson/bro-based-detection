1516225203.362357	Reporter::WARNING	Your trace file likely has invalid TCP checksums, most likely from NIC checksum offloading.  By default, packets with invalid checksums are discarded by Zeek unless using the -C command-line option or toggling the 'ignore_checksums' variable.  Alternatively, disable checksum offloading by the network adapter to ensure Zeek analyzes the actual checksums that are transmitted.	/usr/local/Cellar/zeek/3.0.1_1/share/zeek/base/misc/find-checksum-offloading.zeek, line 54
1516225203.362357	Reporter::WARNING	The analyzed trace file was determined to contain only TCP control packets, which may indicate it's been pre-filtered.  By default, Zeek reports the missing segments for this type of trace, but the 'detect_filtered_trace' option may be toggled if that's not desired.	/usr/local/Cellar/zeek/3.0.1_1/share/zeek/base/misc/find-filtered-trace.zeek, line 48
